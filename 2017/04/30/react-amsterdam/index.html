  <h1>React Amsterdam 2017</h1>
  <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2017</span>
  <p>Last Friday I attended my first React conference. It took place in Amsterdam. So once again I got the opportunity to visit Amsterdam because of a conference. I want to thank organizers of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/praguejs/">PragueJS</a> meetup for giving me a ticket!</p>

<p>This was my biggest conference I ever attended and I must say the organization was pretty good. Location and technical production were perfect and overall I feel pretty positive about the conference.</p>

<p>It started on Thursday when <a href="https://twitter.com/TomislavTenodi">Tomislav Tenodi</a> organized unofficial warmup party. I love those small events when I’m forced to talk to people. For me it’s so much easier to meet people and it gets me into networking mood for a conference.</p>

<h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>

<h3 id="coding-mobile-with-the-pros">Coding Mobile with the Pros</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GantLaborde">Gant Laborde</a> started the React Native track. His company Infinite Red maintains some pretty interesting project and he came to introduce them.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron">Reactotron</a> - Headlined a desktop app for inspecting your React Native projects. You can inspect and change the apps state from nice and simple UI.</p>

<p><a href="https://infinite.red/ignite">Ignite</a> - Great tool to simplify library usage. It links a library into your app and generates examples. Will definitely try it.</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-graphql-application-in-production">A Real-World GraphQL Application in Production</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stefanomasini">Stefano Masini</a> presented advanced how they build GraphQL server at scale. He presented some interesting ways to introduce caching and organize mutations. Architecture they used is called <a href="http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture">Hexagonal Architecture</a>. He was also discussing GraphQL Subscriptions. They faced the problem of correctly subscribing to events. The approach they ended up using was to send all events happening on a page to a single channel.</p>

<h3 id="test-like-its-2017">Test Like It’s 2017</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MicheleBertoli">Michele Bertoli</a> is testing obsessed front end engineer working at Facebook. He presented few tools that will help us with testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/styled-components/jest-styled-components">Jest utilities for Styled Components</a> - Includes styled-components generated css in snapshots.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/styleguidist/snapguidist">Snapguidist</a> do snapshot-based testing inside your <a href="https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist">React Styleguidist</a> styleguide.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/storyshots">StoryShots</a> exactly same for <a href="https://github.com/storybooks/storybook">React Storybook</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/react-fix-it">React Fix It</a> is a great tool which generates test when exceptions occurs. Why should we manually reproduce test case when the browser has all the info to generate it.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-react-native-navigation">Navigating React Native Navigation</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kurtiskemple">Kurtis Kemple</a> and his team invested quite some time into investigating which router would suit them the most. He decided to share their learnings with us.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/native-navigation">Native Navigation</a> promising approach based on building thin layer over native components.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">React Navigation</a> is aiming to share navigation logic between mobile apps, web apps, and server rendering.</p>

<p>I personally have used <a href="https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux">React Native Router</a> and I’m quite happy with it.</p>

<h3 id="complexity-divide-and-conquer">Complexity: Divide and Conquer!</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mweststrate">Michel Weststrate</a> author of MobX shared his thoughts on managing complexity.</p>

<p>What does <em>reactive</em> mean? Separate <em>when</em> and <em>how</em>. What does it mean? Well that you can separate your app login from view layer(React).</p>

<p>I also learned one new MobX function called <a href="https://mobx.js.org/refguide/when.html">when</a>.</p>

<h3 id="flow-typing-a-react-codebase">Flow Typing a React Codebase</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ForbesLindesay">Forbes Lindesay</a> author of <a href="https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/cabbie">Cabbie</a> a webdriver client for node.js and front end engineer at Facebook has shared his tips on <a href="https://flow.org">flow</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mark files for typechecking using <code class="highlighter-rouge">//@flow</code>.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">any</code> type only for experiments.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mixed</code> type is fine, it means that return value doesn’t matter.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://flow.org/en/docs/types/objects/#toc-exact-object-types">Exact object types</a> it helps you catch some typos.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://flow.org/en/docs/types/interfaces/#toc-covariant-read-only-properties-on-interfaces">read-only properties </a> by default.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="party-warmup">Party warmup</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vincentriemer">Vincent Riemer</a> author of fully recreated web-based <a href="https://io808.com">TR-808</a> drum machine and <a href="https://twitter.com/batchass">Bruce Lane</a> have prepared audiovisual party warmup talk about sound in React.</p>

<p>And at the afterparty I finally managed to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">Max Stoiber</a>. He was mentor of a <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-10-01-goodbye-xyz">Rails Girls SoC team</a> I was coaching.</p>

<p class="post__image-center"><img src="/public/react-amsterdam-party.jpg" alt="" class="post__image" /></p>

<h2 id="amsterdam-and-around">Amsterdam and around</h2>

<p>This time I was staying at Haarlem. City about 15 minutes by train away from Amsterdam Centraal. The day after conference I decided to take a hike through Nationaal Park Zuid-Kennemerland.</p>

<p class="post__image-center"><img src="/public/react-amsterdam-park.jpg" alt="" class="post__image" /></p>

<p>Then I really needed coffee so went back to Screaming Beans coffee. It’s lovely small café with tasty coffee.</p>
